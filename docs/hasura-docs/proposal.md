# Postgres: Tables basics

I'm choosing to work with [this page](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/tables/) in the documentation because I feel it's an extension of the topic covered in the first part of the assignment.

## Initial thoughts

If we're starting with the "basics", let's start with the **basics**. The GUI-first nature of the cloud platform attracts developers who may not have as much experience developing APIs from "scratch". If the goal of this document is to introduce a developer - starting with the basics - to the idea of a relational database, let's help them to conceptualize the idea of a table.

To take it a step further, the schema page states the following.

> **You don't need to write a GraphQL schema or resolvers.**

With that in mind, I propose a new starting place for this document to work something like the following page.

:::note
My suggestions end with the "Creating a table" heading only to serve as a starting point for our conversation.
