# Hey there, Marion and Greg <span class="hand-wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>

## Thank you

Before we jump into things, I just wanted to take a second to say thanks for this opportunity. Hasura is a product I've loved for the past few years and it's made my work-life considerably easier. To even sit down with you all and have a conversation is a dream; many thanks!

## Docusaurus

Overkill? Maybe. When I was reading through Muskaan's instructions, I pretty quickly assumed I'd be writing things down for you in `md` files. However, when I refreshed an open window Tuesday and saw that you guys had upgraded to `v2`, I got really excited.

So, I decided to complete this assignment using Docusaurus.

- If you want the repo itself, [have at it](https://github.com/robertjdominguez/hasura-docs)
- You've also been added as collaborators to a cloud project; if there's any issues, give me a shout

### `mdx`!

My excitement really took off when I realized `mdx` is baked into Docusaurus. Docs should be more than reference material and the added functionality `mdx` provides is enormously powerful. I'd really love to talk about this!

## Some initial thoughts

I also wanted to share a few thoughts that shaped the work you'll see. I look forward to discussing these ideas more with you, but wanted to put these concepts in front of you early on.

### Consistency creates clarity

Good documentation is dependent upon a consistent narrative serving as a through line from start to finish. This consistent voice gives clarity to the reader and allows them to jump in at any point/document and feel comfortable.

### Clarity creates engagement

When readers have this clarity, they're intrinsically more engaged with the content. Greater engagement leads to greater understanding and satisfaction.

### Engagement creates happy users

A knowledgeable and satisfied user is a happy user! And, typically, a happy user is a good customer...
